.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBpipe2me\fR is a client for the pipe2me server package, which helps tunnel TCP connections through routers\.
.
.SH "FILES"
\fBpipe2me\fR manages a set of tunnels, with a common FQDN (fully qualified domain name) in a single directory\. This directory contains these files:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIpipe2me\.id_rsa\fR: the SSH public key
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIpipe2me\.id_rsa\.pub\fR: the SSH private key
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIpipe2me\.info\.inc\fR: settings managed by the pipe2me server
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIpipe2me\.local\.inc\fR: settings managed by the client
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIpipe2me\.openssl\.cert\fR: openssl certificate
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIpipe2me\.openssl\.priv\fR: openssl private key
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIpipe2me\.procfile\fR: procfile to run tunnels
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIpipe2me\.monitrc\fR: monit(1) file to run tunnels
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
These options control the pipe2me operations\.
.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show pipe2me help information and exit\.
.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Be more verbose\.
.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Be more quiet\.
.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-silent\fR
Be absolutely silent\.
.
.SH "TUNNEL SETUP"
\fBpipe2me\fR [ options ] setup \.\.\.
.
.br
.
.P
These options control the tunnel setup:
.
.P
Options include:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-\-server\fR, \fB\-s\fR servername: Use pipe2\.me server on that host (default: http://pipe2\.dev)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-\-auth\fR, \fB\-a\fR authtoken:
.
.br
pipe2\.me auth token (default: pipe2\-dev\-token)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-\-protocols\fR, \fB\-p\fR protocols:
.
.br
protocol names, e\.g\. \'http,https,imap\' (default: https)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-\-local\-ports\fR, \fB\-l\fR ports:
.
.br
local ports, one per protocol
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "EXAMPLES"
Setup 3 tunnels under a specific FQDN:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

$ pipe2me setup \-\-protocols=https,http,imap
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SH "SHOW TUNNEL SETTINGS"
\fBpipe2me\fR env
.
.br
.
.P
shows the tunnel configuration in the current directory\. Example:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

$ pipe2me env
\./bin/pipe2me env
PIPE2ME_SERVER=http://pipe2\.dev
PIPE2ME_TOKEN=69o1ykbfzggz9lcd6qjzkggq7
PIPE2ME_FQDN=handsome\-snowwhite\-hamster\.pipe2\.dev

.SH "MANAGE TUNNELS with monit"
The pipe2me client package comes with support for the monit(1) process manager and the daemon(1) daemon package\. These must be installed on the local machine in order to use the following commands\.
.
.P
\fBpipe2me\fR monitrc [ \-\-port <control\-port> ]
.
.br
.
.P
creates a configuration file with commands for all tunnels\.
.
.P
\fBpipe2me\fR monit [ arguments ]
.
.br
.
.P
recreates the monit configuration file and run monit against that\. Note that this command is identical to \fBpipe2me monitrc && monit \-c pipe2me\.monitrc \.\.\.\fR â€“ once you created the monitrc control file you could use the latter for faster startup times\.
.
.SH "START TUNNELS (via foreman)"
The pipe2me\-client comes with support for the foreman process manager\. This allows you to run tunnels without any non\-ruby software\. Due to some limitations with the foreman software this mode should only be used during development and test \- for deployment purposes you should use the monit(1) process manager (see above)\.
.
.P
To start all configured tunnels run
.
.P
\fBpipe2me\fR start
.
.br
.
.SH "TEST TUNNELS (via foreman)"
To help you debug tunnel configurations the pipe2me client comes with a number of echo servers\. (An echo server is a server which responds with a simple string based on the request\.) The current version comes with echo support for the \fIhttp\fR and \fIhttps\fR protocols\.
.
.P
To start all configured tunnels and echo servers run
.
.P
\fBpipe2me\fR echo
.
.br
.
.SH "BUGS"
The installed version of \fBpipe2me\fR is written in Ruby\. A more portable and version of this program \- e\.g\. in bash \- would be welcome\.
.
.SH "LIMITATIONS"
.
.SS "monitrc modus"
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
monit(1) is configured to use a \fBcontrol port\fR, which must be unique on the local machine\. I would prefer to use a local socket, but AFAIK monit does not support that (yet?)\. In the meantime you must make sure that the control port (set via the \fI\-\-port\fR option) is not in use by another process on this machine\. The default value for the control port is 5555\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
monit(1) is configured to log into pipe2me\.monit\.log\. You must make sure that this file is rotated on a regular base\. See monit(1) for details\.
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
\fBIt is strongly recommended to use the created monitrc file as a suggestion and to adjust that configuration according to the needs on the local environment\.\fR
.
.SS "Automatic HTTPS redirections"
When you create a HTTPS tunnel on a server with a name pinkbunny\.pipe2\.server, which ends up at port 1337, the server redirects all connections that arrive at the HTTPS default port (443) to pinkbunny\.pipe2\.server:1337\. This is a convinience feature, but it encrypts this connection step using a wildcard certificate for \fB*\.pipe2\.server\fR\. This means that the initial request \- including and other potentially relevant information \- could be read by the pipe2me server, and is a limitation of the involved protocols\.
.
.P
If you are concerned don\'t use this feature, but use the correct domain name \fBand port\fR from the go\. If you rely on this feature we recommend at least to transfer cookies only on subdirectories\.
